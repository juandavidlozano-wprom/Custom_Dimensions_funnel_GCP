# Novel Real-Time Rule-Based Transformation Approaches on GCP

Below are some **novel approaches** for a **real-time**, rule-based transformation system on GCP. Focus on **instant rule updates** and **continuous data processing**. Each idea includes a high-level design, how rules are stored/queried, and how the user can see changes immediately.

---

## 1. Databricks on GCP with Delta Live Tables & Structured Streaming

### Key Idea
- Use a **Databricks** environment running on GCP (Databricks on Google Cloud) to process real-time data from BigQuery (or a streaming source).  
- Store user-defined rules in a key/value store (Firestore or a small relational DB).  
- Rely on **Delta Live Tables** (or normal Structured Streaming) with a “rule broadcast” mechanism, so updates to rules can propagate in near real time.

### How It Works
1. **Data Flow**
   - Campaign data can be ingested from BigQuery in micro-batches (or from Pub/Sub if you have new events).
   - Databricks **Structured Streaming** reads these batches into a **Delta table**.
2. **Rule Storage**
   - A Firestore collection or a Postgres instance stores the latest version of each rule for each customer.
   - Rules might look like:
     ```json
     {
       "rule_id": "abc123",
       "customer_id": "cust1",
       "condition": "STARTS_WITH",
       "condition_value": "XXX",
       "result_key": "tactic",
       "result_value": "XXXX"
     }
     ```
3. **Rule Broadcast in Spark**
   - A small Spark job (or using Databricks widgets) periodically queries Firestore/Postgres to fetch all rules, then broadcasts them to the cluster.
   - Each streaming micro-batch transformation applies these rules.
4. **Real-Time UI**
   - A custom web UI where users create/update rules.
   - When a rule changes, the UI writes it to Firestore/Postgres. A real-time notification (e.g., a Pub/Sub event) triggers Databricks to reload the rules broadcast set.
   - The next micro-batch run will use the updated rules.
5. **User Preview**
   - Provide a “Preview” endpoint in Databricks: the UI can send a small dataset (sample from BigQuery or Delta) plus the new rule to a Spark job that runs once immediately, returning the results in seconds.
   - If correct, the user commits the rule to the main rules table, making it live for the streaming pipeline.

### Why It’s Novel
- **Delta Live Tables** can simplify pipeline creation and automatically handle data quality or versioning.
- Spark’s structured streaming + broadcast variables can give you near real-time updates as rules change.

### Trade-offs
- Requires Databricks licensing on GCP (can be costlier than purely serverless solutions).
- Real-time means micro-batch intervals (e.g., every few seconds), not absolute millisecond-level streaming.

## 2. GCP Dataflow + Bigtable for On-the-Fly Rule Lookups

### Key Idea
- Leverage **Apache Beam** running on **Google Cloud Dataflow** in **streaming mode**.
- Store transformation rules in **Cloud Bigtable** for low-latency lookups.
- As soon as a user updates a rule in the UI, Dataflow can pull the new rule to transform subsequent data in near real time.

### How It Works
1. **Data Flow**
   - Raw data from BigQuery is streamed out by a “trigger” mechanism (e.g., replicating new rows from BigQuery to Pub/Sub).
   - Dataflow picks up these new records in real time (or micro-batch).
2. **Rule Storage in Bigtable**
   - For each `customer_id`, store rules keyed by some unique row key (e.g., `cust1_rule123`).
   - Each rule row can have columns like `condition_type`, `condition_value`, `result_key`, `result_value`.
3. **Dynamic Rule Fetch**
   - Inside your Beam pipeline, you can do a stateful or side-input approach. For example:
     - Periodically read all rules from Bigtable and keep them in local state.
     - Or do a lookup on a key basis (might be slower if you do it per record, so typically you’d cache in the pipeline).
4. **Custom UI**
   - Users define or edit rules. The UI writes them to Bigtable (or an intermediary like Firestore, then eventually to Bigtable).
   - The pipeline is set to detect changes (e.g., every minute or via an event) and refresh its in-memory copy.
5. **Immediate Preview**
   - The UI can also have a “Preview transformation” endpoint. It sends a small batch of data + the new rule set to a separate “test pipeline” or an on-demand Dataflow job.
   - The job processes the sample data with the updated rules and returns results, typically within seconds to a minute.

### Why It’s Novel
- Bigtable is highly scalable for quick lookups of rule definitions.
- Dataflow can handle large volumes in a streaming manner, continuously applying the newest rules.
- Achieves near real-time transformation as soon as the pipeline reloads updated rules.

### Trade-offs
- Setting up the pipeline to hot-reload or frequently reload rules can be complex.
- Continuous streaming jobs have an always-on cost.

## 3. Databricks Delta Sharing + Real-Time Rule Engine (Redis + Spark Streaming)

### Key Idea
- Keep final or historical data in BigQuery, but for real-time user updates, replicate or share data with a **Spark cluster** (on Dataproc or Databricks).
- Store rules in **Redis** for immediate updates, and the streaming job references Redis as a real-time side store.

### How It Works
1. **Data Pipeline**
   - BigQuery remains your “source of truth,” but you replicate new data to a Delta table on Databricks or an HDFS-like store in near real time.
2. **Rules in Redis**
   - A Redis hash or sorted set stores all the active rules.
   - The user modifies rules in the UI, which updates Redis instantly.
3. **Spark Structured Streaming**
   - A streaming job merges new campaign data from the Delta table with the in-memory rule set from Redis.
   - You can implement a Redis connector in Spark to fetch the rules or keep them in memory with scheduled refreshes.
4. **Preview**
   - The UI could also invoke a small “on-demand” Spark job, or even a local rule evaluator microservice that references Redis to apply rules on a sample data set.
5. **Real-Time Output**
   - The standardized data is then written out to BigQuery or Delta for immediate consumption in dashboards.

### Why It’s Novel
- Redis is extremely fast for storing small sets of frequently changing rule definitions.
- Combines the reliability of Spark streaming with an instantaneous rule store.

### Trade-offs
- Requires a separate streaming environment and replication from BigQuery.
- Monitoring data flow from BigQuery → Delta → Spark → BigQuery can be complex.

## 4. Custom Microservice Layer with “Live SQL Rewrites” + BigQuery

### Key Idea
- Instead of physically transforming data, you intercept queries in a microservice that rewrites them on-the-fly based on user-defined rules.
- This is truly real-time: changes to the rules affect subsequent queries instantly.

### How It Works
1. **Data**
   - Campaign data remains “raw” in BigQuery at all times.
2. **Rule Storage**
   - A small, high-performance DB (e.g., Firestore, Spanner, or Redis) for the rules.
   - The microservice references these rules whenever it receives a query request.
3. **Query Rewrite**
   - When a user or a BI tool queries `SELECT * FROM raw_campaigns`, the microservice intercepts and modifies the SQL to apply the user’s logic, e.g.:
     ```sql
     SELECT
       c.*,
       CASE
         WHEN STARTS_WITH(c.campaign_name, 'XXX') THEN 'XXXX'
         ELSE c.tactic
       END AS tactic
     FROM raw_campaigns c
     ```
   - The microservice does this automatically, based on the rules in the store.
4. **Custom UI**
   - Users define new rules. Immediately, subsequent queries that pass through the microservice see these changes.
5. **Preview**
   - The UI can run a “test query” in the microservice with a limit or filter, showing an instant preview in a table or chart.

### Why It’s Novel
- Zero-latency application of rule changes: once the rules are updated, the next query is affected.
- No separate streaming pipeline or scheduled transformations.
- Could be integrated with Looker/other BI tools by configuring them to query via the microservice endpoint.

### Trade-offs
- Potentially higher query latency if you have a large, complex set of rules.
- Need to build or adapt a custom “SQL rewriting” layer.
- Some queries might get complicated if user transformations must be joined/aggregated in certain ways.

## 5. Vertex AI Feature Store + Real-Time Rule Functions

### Key Idea
- Although Vertex AI Feature Store is typically for ML features, it can act as a real-time dictionary of “campaign attributes” derived from rules.
- A real-time function (Cloud Run or Functions) evaluates new or changed data, applies rules, and updates the Feature Store.
- Downstream queries in BigQuery can join these “features” in near real time.

### How It Works
1. **Data**
   - Campaign data is in BigQuery.
2. **Rules**
   - A custom UI captures rule logic in Firestore or a versioned config.
3. **Real-Time Function**
   - A Cloud Run service or Cloud Function triggers when a record is inserted/updated in BigQuery (via an event-driven approach).
   - This function looks up the relevant rule set from Firestore, calculates “tactic” or “channel,” and upserts those values into the Vertex AI Feature Store keyed by `(customer_id, campaign_id)`.
4. **Query**
   - When analysts query data in BigQuery, they `JOIN` the raw campaign table with the Feature Store (exposed as a table or via an API).
   - Because the function runs in near real-time, the “features” in the store should reflect the latest rules almost immediately.
5. **Preview**
   - The UI can provide a test endpoint that calls the same Cloud Run service with a sample row. The service returns the computed tactic/channel, letting the user confirm correctness.

### Why It’s Novel
- Repurposes Vertex AI Feature Store as a near real-time dictionary of “campaign attributes.”
- Strict versioning/lineage might be an added advantage to track how rules changed over time.
- Easy to integrate if you want to eventually do ML-based campaign optimization.

### Trade-offs
- Overhead in learning Vertex AI Feature Store if you’re not doing ML.
- Additional cost for storing data there, plus Cloud Run/Functions.
- Still mostly micro-batch event-based, not sub-second streaming.

## 6. dbt on GCP for Near Real-Time Micro-Batch Transformations

### Key Idea
- Utilize **dbt** running in the cloud (e.g., dbt Cloud or Cloud Build/Composer) to orchestrate **frequent micro-batch** transformations in BigQuery.
- Store rules in a separate real-time-accessible system (e.g., Firestore or a table in BigQuery). dbt dynamically incorporates them into SQL models when triggered.
- Triggers can run dbt jobs every few minutes or upon certain events, allowing near real-time updates.

### How It Works
1. **Data Pipeline**
   - Keep your campaign data in BigQuery’s “raw” or “staging” datasets.
   - dbt transformations produce “transformed” tables or incremental models in BigQuery.
2. **Rule Storage**
   - A Firestore collection or a versioned table in BigQuery holds the active rule sets (similar JSON or condition/value pairs).
   - The dbt project includes macros that fetch these rules (via a query or API call) and apply them as CASE expressions or logic in your models.
3. **Frequent Runs (Micro-Batch)**
   - Instead of a daily or hourly dbt job, schedule it to run every few minutes or trigger it via Cloud Scheduler, Cloud Composer, or even a Pub/Sub event.
   - Because dbt is SQL-based, the updated rules are effectively “joined” or “CASE’d” into the next build.
4. **UI + Preview**
   - A custom UI allows users to add or modify rules in Firestore/BigQuery.
   - For immediate preview: the UI can call a “test run” job in dbt (e.g., `dbt run -m preview_model`) on a small dataset or ephemeral schema. The job completes in seconds/minutes.
   - If the result looks good, the UI marks the rule “active.” The next scheduled dbt job will apply it to the full dataset.
5. **Real-Time Feasibility**
   - While dbt is not a sub-second streaming engine, running it every few minutes can get close to real-time for many business use cases. 
   - Each time the job starts, it queries the updated rule set and applies it.

### Why It’s Novel
- dbt is typically used for batch transformations, but you can scale down the interval to near real-time micro-batches.
- Storing rules in BigQuery or Firestore ensures you can apply changes without changing dbt code each time.
- The same well-known dbt templating, version control, and documentation still apply.

### Trade-offs
- True streaming or sub-second changes are not feasible here (dbt is still a batch engine at heart).
- More frequent dbt runs increase cost and overhead in build times.
- Some additional complexity in macros to incorporate external rule definitions on each run.

**General Pattern**:
1. **User modifies a rule** in a custom UI.  
2. **Rule is stored** in a real-time-accessible system (Firestore, Bigtable, Redis, etc.).  
3. **Pipeline or microservice** dynamically picks up the new rule.  
4. **Preview** is handled by a “test pipeline” or “test query” using the updated rule set on a small data sample.

All of these solutions offer near real-time or “live” updates, letting the user go back and forth applying new rules and instantly seeing the impact on the data. The best fit depends on **team skill set**, **budget**, **latency needs**, and **data volume**.
